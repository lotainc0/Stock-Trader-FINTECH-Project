md("""# 🔦 Lighthouse — explainable stock decisions for self-directed investors

*A clear signal in a noisy market.*

Lighthouse turns a ticker and a few facts about **you** (horizon, risk tolerance, the most you are willing to lose) into a
**Buy / Hold / Sell verdict, a position plan and the reasons behind it** — then shows you honestly how that rule would have
behaved in the past.

This notebook runs the full product end-to-end:

1. **Data collection & cleaning** — prices, volume, fundamentals, the S&P 500 benchmark
2. **Fundamental analysis** — valuation, quality and growth *beacons*
3. **Technical analysis** — six beacons (trend, RSI, MACD, Bollinger, volume, 52-week breakout)
4. **Market weather** — bull/bear × calm/turbulent regime detection
5. **Decision** — explainable score → verdict → position size, exit level and max loss
6. **Strategy testing** — point-in-time backtest vs. buy-and-hold and the S&P 500, layer attribution, sensitivity, out-of-sample test
7. **Watchlist ranking**

> Runs on Google Colab or any Jupyter. With internet access it downloads live data; without it, it falls back to the bundled
> historical sample pack (Microsoft 1986–2017 with volume, 19 other S&P stocks 1990–2022, S&P 500 index) so it always runs end to end.

md("""## Limitations and risks (read before acting)

* **Single-stock timing is hard.** On relentlessly compounding mega-caps, any rule that is sometimes in cash trails buy-and-hold on
  raw return. Lighthouse's value is *risk-managed* exposure: lower drawdowns, smaller positions in turbulent markets, and an
  explicit worst-case loss — judge it on Sharpe, drawdown and the regime table, not on total return alone.
* **Sector norms are assumptions**, not live peer data. Edit them in `lighthouse/fundamentals.py` if you disagree.
* **Fundamental history is short** (Yahoo provides ~4-5 annual statements), so the point-in-time gate only acts in recent years.
* **Costs are simple** (10 bps round trip per side), taxes are ignored, stops are checked at the close.
* **Not investment advice.** Lighthouse is a decision-support tool: it shows you the evidence and its reasoning; the decision is yours.
